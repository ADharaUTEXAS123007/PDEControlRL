-Network often generates too less forces to approximate the target field
        well
    => Mainly when the target differs strongly from the result of an
            uncontrolled simulation
        => In many cases those two do not differ very much
            => Might be problematic for l2-loss
    => Field proximity/force strength reward parameters seem off balance
    => Should experiment with alternative weightings
