 
-Training was relatively short, shows some promise in the end
-Overall relatively slow progress
-Variance noticeable but not completely over the top

-Seems to always perform a clockwise swirling motion that will hit the 
        target shape at some point during the trajectory
    => Reward function rewards coverage of goal shape in every time step
            instead of just at the end, this is exploited
-Problems when the initial shape is in the center of the field
        (see example 0003), swirling here just rotates the density values around
-High forces created, density values are strongly spread across the field
    => Forces not being considered in reward has its effect
