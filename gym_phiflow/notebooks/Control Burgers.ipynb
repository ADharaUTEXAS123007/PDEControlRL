    "# Controlling Burgers' Equation with Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "This notebook will present the results of using reinforcement learning to control Burgers' equation, a nonlinear PDE. The results are then compared to a supervised single-shooting method using the differentiable PDE solver [Î¦<sub>Flow</sub>](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow). The reinforcement learning method uses the framework [stable_baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)"

    "To classify the results of the reinforcement learning method, they are compared to a supervised control force estimator approach using a differentiable solver. This comparison seems natural as both algorithms work by optimizing through trial and error. While the CFE approach has the advantage of the differentiable solver, the reinforcement learning approach is not limited by training dataset size. However, this also introduces additional simulation overhead during training to generate the ground truth trajectories. This can increase training duration."
