-Network roughly manages to approximate target field
-Very quick transition, as to be expected if forces are not considered
-Approximation appears "spiky", neighboring field values often on
        opposite sides of the corresponding target field values
    => Could smooth out with longer training
    => Network seems able to comprehend the goal
-Rewards still increase after 800 epochs, sometimes large dips in 
        performance
    => Probably exploration by the network
