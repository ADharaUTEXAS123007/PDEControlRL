-Again the clockwise swirl
-Network just seems to try distributing the density values evenly across
        the field
-According to the average reward values, the network manages to achieve
        clear progress in the fist 200 epochs, then advancement seems to
        stop
    => Might be the point at which the network has learned to distribute
            density points evenly
    -But: further progress might be possible at the end of training
    -Possibly the network could at first learn to distribute density
            values evenly and then to more and more focus them onto the
            target area
-Penalizing forces might hinder the equal distribution of fluid across
        the grid
